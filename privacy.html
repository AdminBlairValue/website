    <h1>BlairValue Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="muted"><strong>Updated:</strong> <em>November 1, 2025</em></p>

    <h2>1. Our Commitment to Privacy</h2>
    <p>At BlairValue, your trust matters. We believe that value shouldn’t be a mystery — and that includes the value of your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how BlairValue (“BlairValue,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) collects, uses, stores, shares, and protects your information when you visit <a href="https://blairvalue.com">https://blairvalue.com</a>, use our apps, or interact with our AI-powered resale valuation services (the “Service”). BlairValue uses intelligent technology to help people and businesses understand what their items are worth. In doing so, we handle data carefully and transparently, consistent with this Policy.</p>

    <h2>2. Scope of This Policy</h2>
    <p>This Policy applies to all users of BlairValue’s website, software, mobile experiences, and related services, including visitors, registered users, and business clients. It does not apply to third-party websites, services, or integrations we link to (such as marketplaces or payment processors). Their privacy practices are governed by their own policies.</p>

    <h2>3. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>BlairValue collects information to deliver and improve our resale valuation tools, ensure secure operation, and provide helpful insights. We collect information in three main ways:</p>

    <h3>A. Information You Provide</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Account details:</strong> name, email address, password, phone number (if provided);</li>
      <li><strong>Item data:</strong> photos, descriptions, category, condition, purchase price, and related item details for valuation;</li>
      <li><strong>Business information:</strong> resale store name, inventory uploads, or account integrations;</li>
      <li><strong>Payment information:</strong> processed securely by third-party payment processors — we do not store full payment card numbers;</li>
      <li><strong>Communications:</strong> emails, customer support messages, or feedback you send us.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>B. Information Collected Automatically</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Device and browser data (e.g., IP address, operating system, type, and version);</li>
      <li>Usage data (pages visited, actions taken, clicks, referring URLs, session duration);</li>
      <li>Cookies and analytics identifiers that help us understand how the Service is used and improve performance.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can manage cookie preferences in your browser or device settings.</p>

    <h3>C. Information from Third Parties</h3>
    <p>If you connect BlairValue with external services (such as marketplaces, e-commerce stores, or inventory platforms), we may receive limited information from those accounts — such as product listings, item IDs, or pricing data — according to your authorization. We also may receive aggregated market data from analytics providers to train and enhance our pricing algorithms.</p>

    <h2>4. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide the Service — including AI valuations, reports, and insights;</li>
      <li>Operate and improve our models, features, and site functionality;</li>
      <li>Personalize your experience;</li>
      <li>Process payments and subscriptions;</li>
      <li>Communicate with you about updates, offers, and support;</li>
      <li>Maintain security and enforce our Terms of Service;</li>
      <li>Comply with legal obligations.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>We do not sell your personal data. Ever.</strong></p>

    <h2>5. How We Share Information</h2>
    <h3>A. Service Providers</h3>
    <p>We use trusted vendors (hosting, analytics, email, and payment processors). These providers are bound by confidentiality and data protection agreements and may only use data to perform their specific services for us.</p>
    <h3>B. Integrations You Authorize</h3>
    <p>If you connect your BlairValue account to a marketplace or external tool, you permit data sharing with that integration. You can disable integrations anytime in your settings.</p>
    <h3>C. Legal or Safety Requirements</h3>
    <p>We may disclose information if required by law, court order, or government request, or if necessary to protect our rights, users, or the public; prevent fraud or abuse; or enforce our Terms of Service.</p>
    <h3>D. Business Transfers</h3>
    <p>If BlairValue is involved in a merger, acquisition, financing, or sale, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction.</p>

    <h2>6. AI, Analytics, and Data Retention</h2>
    <p>Our AI-powered systems analyze item data to produce valuation estimates. We may use anonymized and aggregated data to improve algorithm accuracy. We do not use user-uploaded content to train third-party models without explicit permission.</p>

    <h2>7. Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>
    <p>BlairValue uses cookies and similar technologies to keep you signed in, measure performance, remember preferences, and deliver relevant content. You can manage cookies in your browser settings.</p>

    <h2>8. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>BlairValue is not directed to children under 13 and does not knowingly collect personal data from minors without parental consent.</p>

    <h2>9. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We use administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect your information — including encryption, secure hosting, and access controls. However, no system is completely secure, and you are responsible for maintaining your account credentials.</p>

    <h2>10. International Data Transfers</h2>
    <p>BlairValue is based in the United States. If you access the Service from another country, your data may be processed in the U.S. or other jurisdictions that may not have the same data protection laws as your home country.</p>

    <h2>11. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Access, correction, deletion, portability, objection/restriction, and marketing opt-out rights as permitted by law.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To exercise your rights, contact us at <a href="mailto:admin@blairvalue.com">admin@blairvalue.com</a>. We may need to verify your identity.</p>

    <h2>12. Communications Preferences</h2>
    <p>You may opt out of marketing communications by clicking “unsubscribe” in any email or adjusting your settings.</p>

    <h2>13. Retention and Account Deletion</h2>
    <p>We keep data only as long as needed for legitimate purposes. You can request deletion of your account and data by emailing <a href="mailto:admin@blairvalue.com">admin@blairvalue.com</a>.</p>

    <h2>14. Third-Party Links</h2>
    <p>Our website may contain links to other websites not operated by BlairValue. We are not responsible for their content or privacy practices.</p>

    <h2>15. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Policy periodically. Material changes will be posted on our website or emailed to users.</p>

    <h2>16. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>For privacy inquiries or data protection questions, contact us at <a href="mailto:admin@blairvalue.com">admin@blairvalue.com</a>.</p>

    <h2>17. Additional Information for California Residents (CCPA/CPRA)</h2>
    <p>If you are a California resident, you have rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA). To exercise these rights, email us at <a href="mailto:admin@blairvalue.com">admin@blairvalue.com</a> with “CCPA Request” in the subject line.</p>

    <h2>18. Additional Information for European Economic Area (EEA) and UK Users</h2>
    <p>If you reside in the EEA or the UK, you have rights under the GDPR, including access, rectification, erasure, restriction, objection, and data portability. You can contact us or your local data protection authority to raise concerns.</p>

    <h2>19. Our Promise</h2>
    <p>We will continue to update our privacy practices to keep your information secure and transparent. At BlairValue, we believe trust is earned through clarity — in both value and privacy.</p>
