    <h1>BlairValue Terms of Service</h1>
    <p class="muted"><strong>Updated:</strong> <em>November 1, 2025</em></p>

    <h2>1. Overview &amp; Acceptance</h2>
    <p>Welcome to BlairValue (“BlairValue,” “we,” “us,” or “our”). These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your use of our website, products, software, and related services (collectively, the “Service”). By accessing or using BlairValue, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, you may not use the Service.</p>
    <p>We may modify these Terms at any time. If we make material changes, we will notify you through the website or email before they take effect. Continued use of the Service after changes are posted means you accept the revised Terms.</p>

    <h2>2. What BlairValue Does (and Doesn’t) Do</h2>
    <p>BlairValue provides AI-powered tools to help users understand the resale value of items they own. Our system analyzes market data and produces resale insights, comparable listings, and inventory management tools.</p>
    <p>BlairValue does not buy, sell, or broker any items. We are an information and analytics platform, not a resale marketplace.</p>
    <p>Our valuations are estimates — not appraisals, guarantees, or certified financial advice. Prices are based on market conditions and may fluctuate.</p>

    <h2>3. Eligibility, Accounts &amp; Security</h2>
    <p>You must be at least 13 years old (or the minimum age required in your jurisdiction) to use BlairValue. If you are under 18, you must have permission from a parent or guardian.</p>
    <p>You are responsible for the accuracy of the information you provide and for keeping your account credentials secure. BlairValue is not liable for any loss resulting from unauthorized account use.</p>
    <p>You agree not to share your account credentials or use another person’s account. Notify us immediately at <a href="mailto:admin@blairvalue.com">admin@blairvalue.com</a> if you suspect unauthorized access.</p>

    <h2>4. Plans, Fees, and Billing</h2>
    <p>Some BlairValue features require a paid plan or subscription. By subscribing, you agree to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Pay applicable fees using an approved payment method;</li>
      <li>Permit automatic renewals unless canceled before the renewal date;</li>
      <li>Maintain accurate payment and contact information.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All fees are non-refundable except where required by law or specifically stated by BlairValue. We may change pricing or plan features for future billing cycles, but we will provide notice before any material change takes effect.</p>

    <h2>5. Acceptable Use</h2>
    <p>You agree not to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use the Service for unlawful or deceptive purposes;</li>
      <li>Upload or distribute viruses, malware, or harmful code;</li>
      <li>Interfere with the security or operation of the Service;</li>
      <li>Use scraping, bots, or automated systems to extract data without written permission;</li>
      <li>Misrepresent AI valuations as official or guaranteed appraisals;</li>
      <li>Infringe on the intellectual property or privacy rights of others.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We may suspend or terminate your access if we determine your behavior violates these Terms, poses a risk to others, or harms the Service.</p>

    <h2>6. Your Content &amp; License to BlairValue</h2>
    <p>You retain ownership of any data, descriptions, photos, or other content you upload (“Your Content”).</p>
    <p>By using the Service, you grant BlairValue a limited, worldwide, royalty-free license to process, analyze, and display Your Content as necessary to operate and improve the Service.</p>
    <p>You represent that you have the rights and permissions to upload any content you submit. If you submit feedback, ideas, or suggestions, BlairValue may use them without compensation or restriction.</p>

    <h2>7. BlairValue Content &amp; Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>All BlairValue software, algorithms, models, analytics, text, images, design elements, and other materials are the property of BlairValue or its licensors and are protected by intellectual property laws.</p>
    <p>You may not copy, modify, distribute, reverse-engineer, or create derivative works from any part of the Service. BlairValue grants you a limited, non-exclusive, revocable license to access and use the Service in accordance with these Terms.</p>

    <h2>8. Integrations and Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>BlairValue may offer optional integrations with third-party services such as marketplaces, point-of-sale systems, or inventory platforms.</p>
    <p>If you connect a third-party account, you authorize BlairValue to access and process related data solely to provide the Service.</p>
    <p>Third-party services are governed by their own terms and privacy policies. BlairValue is not responsible for their actions or data practices. You may disconnect integrations at any time.</p>

    <h2>9. AI-Generated Valuations and Data</h2>
    <p>BlairValue uses artificial intelligence and market data to generate price estimates, value insights, and recommendations.</p>
    <p>These outputs are informational and not certified appraisals or guaranteed results. Actual resale outcomes may differ based on market conditions, demand, item condition, and other factors.</p>
    <p>You are solely responsible for verifying and determining how to use BlairValue’s data or insights.</p>

    <h2>10. Privacy</h2>
    <p>Your use of BlairValue is also governed by our Privacy Policy, available at <a href="https://blairvalue.com/privacy.html">https://blairvalue.com/privacy.html</a>. Our Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard personal data. By using BlairValue, you consent to that policy.</p>

    <h2>11. Beta Features and Service Updates</h2>
    <p>From time to time, BlairValue may release beta or experimental features. These may be incomplete, less reliable, or changed at any time.</p>
    <p>We may update, modify, or discontinue parts of the Service to improve performance, comply with law, or enhance user experience. We will provide reasonable notice for material changes affecting paid features.</p>

    <h2>12. Termination</h2>
    <p>You may close your account or cancel your subscription at any time.</p>
    <p>BlairValue may suspend or terminate your account if you violate these Terms, fail to pay fees, or engage in activities that harm the Service or other users.</p>
    <p>Upon termination, your right to use the Service ends immediately. We may delete or de-identify your data in accordance with our Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h2>13. Disclaimers</h2>
    <p>The Service and all related content, data, and materials are provided “as is” and “as available.”</p>
    <p>BlairValue makes no warranties, express or implied, about the accuracy, completeness, or reliability of valuations, data, or analytics provided.</p>
    <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, BlairValue disclaims all warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, or uninterrupted operation.</p>

    <h2>14. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>BlairValue and its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, and agents are not liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including lost profits, data, or goodwill;</li>
      <li>BlairValue’s total liability for any claim will not exceed the greater of (a) $100 USD or (b) the total amount you paid to BlairValue during the 12 months before the claim arose.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Some jurisdictions do not allow certain limitations, so parts of this section may not apply to you.</p>

    <h2>15. Indemnification</h2>
    <p>You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless BlairValue, its affiliates, officers, and employees from any claims, damages, liabilities, or expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees) arising out of:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your use of the Service;</li>
      <li>Your violation of these Terms;</li>
      <li>Your violation of any law or third-party rights;</li>
      <li>Any content you submit or share through BlairValue.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>16. Governing Law</h2>
    <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Texas, without regard to conflict-of-law principles. Any disputes that are not subject to arbitration (see Section 19) will be resolved exclusively in the state or federal courts of Travis County, Texas.</p>

    <h2>17. Export Compliance</h2>
    <p>You agree to comply with all applicable export control and sanctions laws. You will not use or provide access to the Service in embargoed countries or to prohibited persons or entities.</p>

    <h2>18. Contact Information</h2>
    <p>BlairValue LLC<br />
      Website: <a href="https://blairvalue.com">https://blairvalue.com</a><br />
      Email: <a href="mailto:admin@blairvalue.com">admin@blairvalue.com</a><br />
      You consent to receive notices electronically. Notices will be considered received when sent to your registered email address.</p>

    <h2>19. Dispute Resolution, Arbitration, and Class Action Waiver</h2>
    <h3>19.1 Informal Resolution</h3>
    <p>Before filing any claim, you agree to contact <a href="mailto:admin@blairvalue.com">admin@blairvalue.com</a> and attempt to resolve the issue informally. Most disputes can be resolved without formal proceedings. If a dispute is not resolved within 30 days, either party may initiate arbitration.</p>

    <h3>19.2 Binding Arbitration</h3>
    <p>You and BlairValue agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or your use of the Service (“Dispute”) will be resolved by final and binding arbitration, not in court. The Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) governs this section. Arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules, with modifications consistent with these Terms. The arbitration will take place in Travis County, Texas, or by video conference if both parties agree. The arbitrator may award the same individual relief that a court could, but only to the extent necessary to resolve the individual claim.</p>

    <h3>19.3 Exceptions</h3>
    <p>Either party may:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Bring a qualifying claim in small-claims court; or</li>
      <li>Seek injunctive relief in court for intellectual property misuse or unauthorized access to the Service.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>19.4 Class Action Waiver</h3>
    <p>You and BlairValue agree that all Disputes will be resolved on an individual basis only. You may not bring claims as a class, representative, or collective action, nor participate in such actions. The arbitrator has no authority to consolidate claims or conduct any class or representative proceeding. If a court finds this waiver unenforceable as to a specific claim, that claim must proceed in court; all other claims remain subject to arbitration.</p>

    <h3>19.5 Opt-Out Option</h3>
    <p>You may opt out of this arbitration agreement within 30 days of first accepting these Terms by sending an email to <a href="mailto:admin@blairvalue.com">admin@blairvalue.com</a> with the subject line “Arbitration Opt-Out.” Include your name, account email, and a statement that you wish to opt out. Opting out of arbitration does not affect other provisions of these Terms.</p>

    <h3>19.6 Fees</h3>
    <p>If your AAA filing fee exceeds the filing fee for small-claims court, BlairValue will pay the difference. Each party is responsible for its own attorneys’ fees unless the arbitrator rules otherwise under applicable law.</p>

    <h3>19.7 Governing Law for Arbitration</h3>
    <p>This arbitration agreement is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq.) and the laws of the State of Texas, without regard to conflict-of-law principles.</p>

    <h3>19.8 Survival</h3>
    <p>This Section 19 will survive termination of your account or these Terms.</p>

    <h2>20. Miscellaneous</h2>
    <p><strong>Entire Agreement:</strong> These Terms and our Privacy Policy represent the complete agreement between you and BlairValue.</p>
    <p><strong>Severability:</strong> If any provision is found invalid, the remainder remains in full effect.</p>
    <p><strong>No Waiver:</strong> Failure to enforce any provision does not constitute a waiver.</p>
    <p><strong>Assignment:</strong> You may not assign your rights or obligations without BlairValue’s prior written consent.</p>
    <p><strong>Force Majeure:</strong> BlairValue is not liable for delays or failures caused by events beyond our reasonable control, such as natural disasters, cyberattacks, or government actions.</p>

    <h2>21. Region-Specific Rights</h2>
    <p>If you live in a jurisdiction with mandatory consumer protection laws that grant you additional rights, those laws will apply where required. BlairValue’s limitations and disclaimers will apply to the fullest extent permitted by those laws.</p>
